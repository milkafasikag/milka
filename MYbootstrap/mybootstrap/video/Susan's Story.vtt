Hi.

1
00:00:01.572 --> 00:00:02.585
I'm Susan sarahch.

2
00:00:02.618 --> 00:00:03.641
Welcome to Susie Cakes.

3
00:00:03.706 --> 00:00:06.153
I founded Susie Cakes for two
primary reasons.

4
00:00:06.202 --> 00:00:08.367
The first was a tribute to my
Midwestern grandmothers,

5
00:00:08.378 --> 00:00:10.669
Mildred and Madeline.

6
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.121
I spent a lot of time growing
up in both of their kitchens.

7
00:00:14.186 --> 00:00:16.905
They lived across the alleyway
from each other, and I was very

8
00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:19.871
fortunate to come home every
day to something fabulous on

9
00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:21.033
top of the kitchen table.

10
00:00:21.082 --> 00:00:24.136
Whether it was an apple pie or
a pound cake, it was a time

11
00:00:24.148 --> 00:00:27.237
where we sat down and connected
about our day.

12
00:00:27.404 --> 00:00:30.705
Women of their generation had
very little opportunity outside

13
00:00:30.716 --> 00:00:32.176
of the home for careers.

14
00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:34.721
And when I inherited all their
three by five handwritten

15
00:00:34.732 --> 00:00:38.503
recipe cards, I thought, what a
better way to pay tribute to

16
00:00:38.514 --> 00:00:42.005
women of that generation than
to open a whole business around

17
00:00:42.016 --> 00:00:43.317
their baked goods?

18
00:00:43.494 --> 00:00:46.517
The second reason I founded
Susie Cakes was because I was

19
00:00:46.528 --> 00:00:48.761
in the hospitality business for
15 years.

20
00:00:48.816 --> 00:00:51.365
I worked in hotels and
restaurants, fine dining,

21
00:00:51.376 --> 00:00:55.279
nightclubs, and had noticed a
lot of women

22
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.401
left the industry when they
started to get married and have

23
00:00:59.412 --> 00:00:59.901
children.

24
00:01:00.036 --> 00:01:02.361
And I thought, there's got to
be a way that women could have

25
00:01:02.372 --> 00:01:04.988
progressive careers in food
service without sacrificing

26
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.241
their family or their personal
time.

27
00:01:08.376 --> 00:01:11.651
So the mission behind Susie
Cakes is about allowing food

28
00:01:11.662 --> 00:01:14.483
service professionals and
hospitality professionals to

29
00:01:14.494 --> 00:01:18.240
have a balance between their
career and their life outside

30
00:01:18.252 --> 00:01:19.361
of their career.

31
00:01:19.426 --> 00:01:21.142
So there are a number of
factors that set Susie Cakes

32
00:01:21.154 --> 00:01:22.145
apart.

33
00:01:22.338 --> 00:01:24.647
First and foremost, our mission
is connecting through

34
00:01:24.658 --> 00:01:25.601
celebrations.

35
00:01:25.746 --> 00:01:27.505
We're a purposeful organization.

36
00:01:27.618 --> 00:01:29.984
And what that means to me is
that our team members are

37
00:01:29.996 --> 00:01:31.397
connecting with each other.

38
00:01:31.564 --> 00:01:33.947
We are connecting with our
guests through our baked goods,

39
00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.477
and then our guests are
connecting with their family

40
00:01:35.488 --> 00:01:37.573
and loved ones through our
baked goods.

41
00:01:37.622 --> 00:01:39.365
Because no one really is eating
a cake alone.

42
00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:42.052
It's always about sharing it
with somebody else, and it's

43
00:01:42.064 --> 00:01:45.049
usually around a special
occasion, or it can be just

44
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.329
because it's Tuesday.

45
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.401
It's Susie cakes.

46
00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:49.977
Everything is made with
butterflower, sugar, eggs.

47
00:01:50.074 --> 00:01:53.849
We don't use any preservatives
trans fats in our products, so

48
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.332
it's good old fashioned baked
goods like you would have

49
00:01:56.344 --> 00:01:57.729
gotten in 1950.

50
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.389
I always wanted to have a
company that would eventually

51
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.577
become a national brand and
become a household name.

52
00:02:04.664 --> 00:02:08.493
Whether you're in Greenwich,
Connecticut, or in Kansas City,

53
00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:11.287
when somebody mentions a
celebration or a cake CD, cakes

54
00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:13.125
is the first thing that comes
to their mind.

55
00:02:13.228 --> 00:02:16.177
That is our ultimate goal, and
we are well on our way to that

56
00:02:16.188 --> 00:02:16.913
goal.

57
00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:19.531
We are looking for the most
passionate culinary

58
00:02:19.542 --> 00:02:23.531
professionals and hospitality
professionals that the industry

59
00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:24.393
has to offer.

60
00:02:24.512 --> 00:02:27.941
The first quality we look for
are people who want to be part

61
00:02:27.952 --> 00:02:32.251
of this industry, who love
baked goods, who love desserts,

62
00:02:32.262 --> 00:02:33.657
who love connecting with people.

63
00:02:33.744 --> 00:02:36.033
That's the first criteria for
working at Susie Cake.

64
00:02:36.102 --> 00:02:38.749
One of our values at Susie
Cakes is actually we have fun.

65
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.121
That is one of our values.

66
00:02:40.186 --> 00:02:43.497
In our team Member handbook,
and we live this every single

67
00:02:43.508 --> 00:02:43.885
day.

68
00:02:43.908 --> 00:02:46.371
I think it's important that
everybody is laughing and

69
00:02:46.382 --> 00:02:48.993
having a good time when they
are at work.

70
00:02:49.112 --> 00:02:52.733
To that end, we have quarterly
luncheons that are usually

71
00:02:52.744 --> 00:02:53.613
potluck.

72
00:02:53.662 --> 00:02:55.233
Everybody brings something in.

73
00:02:55.352 --> 00:02:57.389
We have team member of the
quarter.

74
00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.753
We do Exceeds Expectations
Awards, which could be a $10

75
00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:02.945
gift card to target when
somebody is doing something

76
00:03:02.956 --> 00:03:05.301
great or connecting with
somebody.

77
00:03:05.436 --> 00:03:07.765
So we try to infuse that every
single day.

78
00:03:07.788 --> 00:03:12.213
In our culture, it's an upbeat,
energetic and fun place to be.

79
00:03:12.332 --> 00:03:14.551
The time spent in my
grandmother's kitchen were

80
00:03:14.562 --> 00:03:17.873
really important to me, and
they really made me the woman

81
00:03:17.884 --> 00:03:19.317
who I am today.

82
00:03:19.484 --> 00:03:22.137
And Anne, as such, nothing
brings me greater joy than to

83
00:03:22.148 --> 00:03:24.857
come into the bakery in the
afternoon and to see a parent

84
00:03:24.868 --> 00:03:27.737
with their child enjoying a
cupcake, having that same

85
00:03:27.748 --> 00:03:30.139
connection that I did with my
grandmother so many years ago.
