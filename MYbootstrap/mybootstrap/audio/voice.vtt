00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.765
Everybody has a turnback moment.

1
00:00:02.948 --> 00:00:06.137
You have a moment where you
could go forward or you can

2
00:00:06.148 --> 00:00:07.213
give up.

3
00:00:07.412 --> 00:00:11.241
But the thing you have to keep
in mind before you give up is

4
00:00:11.252 --> 00:00:16.200
that if you give up, the
guarantee is it will never

5
00:00:16.212 --> 00:00:17.165
happen.

6
00:00:17.348 --> 00:00:20.504
That's the guarantee of
quitting, that it will never

7
00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:21.421
happen.

8
00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:23.021
No way under the sun.

9
00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:27.585
The only way the possibility
remains that it can happen is

10
00:00:27.596 --> 00:00:31.139
if you never give up, no matter
what.
